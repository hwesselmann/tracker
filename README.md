# Tracker
A Tennis match tracker for Android powered devices.

## Why does this project exist?
My family is crazy about Tennis and most of our daytime and weekend activities relate to this amazing sport.
In the past, I checked all the great pieces of software making match stats tracking available and chose the awesome
_Tennis Math_ app by developer Suprematic. It has all the features I need for my personal use, has nice looks and works very reliable.
Unfortunately, it does not work on Android versions newer than 6.x and my current phone has 7.1.2. As the developer cannot put priority onto updating the app and it is cloused source, I chose to start an app that can do the things I need and comes without ads or purchasable premium content.

## What can tracker do?
For now: It compiles. I just started out this project (and Android development in general) and spend more time on the Tennis court than in front of my computer. Please be patient - any help is apreciated!

## What features are planned?
Please check the issues tab for what I think should be in the application for now. i will update the README as the project takes shape.
